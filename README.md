# YarnCrossectionImageProcessing

This project has the code for creating a draw board using python on which user can draw some images, which are then saved and used in final training model.

This project uses CNN for training over 10,000 images of yarn cross-section to predict the type of the fiber and the radial density of the fibers along the radius.

This task which has been done manually could be eaisly automated also expeidting the process of analyzing the different yarn type for their different property.

The final result of the algorithm predict with >95% accuracy the type of fiber in a blended yarn.
